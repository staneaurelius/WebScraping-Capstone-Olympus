Of course, there are multiple ways of killing time, and one of the best way to do it is by watching movies. There is a little problem however, that people do not know what movies to watch. Thus, we would like to give an analysis on the most popular movies in 2021. This will give people an idea of what movie to watch in 2021.\n",
